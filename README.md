#The Tokyo Metro: The intersection of culture and urban design to create an efficient mass transit system.

This project was undertaken as part of the Columbia Undergraduate Scholars Program Summer Enhancement Fellowship. I was awarded funding to travel to Tokyo and undertake urban design and ethnoagraphical research to look at the link between culture and technology in making an efficient public transit system.

The **final paper** is in this repo, along with some other useful resources from my project, and the slides from a research presentation I gave at Columbia.
